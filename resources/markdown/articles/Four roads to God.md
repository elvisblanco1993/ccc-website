# Four Roads to God

Many people today would love to be able to have access to God- if He exists, most any way they want.  After all, why can't there be more than one way to God? Is it fair that Christians say, there's only way ([John 14:6][1])?

Does it matter? This issue of how we know God or a heaven is real, is a critical question because it's at the heart of what gives your life and mine meaning. It's why we examine life. Someone said "a life unexamined, is a life not worth living."
 
So maybe there's more than one way or road after all.  In fact, the Bible says there may be 4 roads to God. Are they 4 different roads or are they 4 paths to the same road? Let's travel on these roads or paths and see where they lead..
 
 

### Road 1 Creation:

> For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks.

***Romans 1:20-21***

Our world-view or philosophy of life, the way we choose to live, is predicated upon what kind of creature we think we are. It's been said that we live as we think. If one thinks he's just a higher form of an animal, and this world is all there is before we die, then you'll live in a way consistent with that view.
However, if you believe that you were made in the image of a creator God who you are then accountable to for your life and one that may come, you'll be prone to live that way. So essentially, mankind has two choices. Either we evolved out of slime accidentally, by random chance, or we have been intelligently designed or made with a heavenly pattern and purpose. The implications are profound as you try to find the road to God, or a road to God or just peace and love.
God if He is real and true, is angry at people- sinners, because they do not acknowledge Him, or give Him thanks and due worship, and He reveals that wrath or anger constantly at those who reject Him.

> As it is written: "There is none righteous, no, not one;

***Romans 3:10***

> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.

***Romans 3:23***

### Road 2 Conscience:

> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them.

***Romans 1:18-19***

The Bible in [Romans 1:18][2] tells us that we "suppress" (push away) the "truth" that God has "written in our hearts" ([Ro. 2:14-15][3]) about ourselves and our nature without a right relationship with Him. So our understanding of creation works through conscience to point us towards God. H.L Mencken said, "Conscience is the inner voice which warns us that someone may be looking."
The Bible says your conscience can excuse or accuse you, or, it can indict or convict you.  Convict you of what? It will convict you of your sin and rebellion towards God and the price we must pay for that rebellion and sin.
 
> For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

***Romans 6:23***

### Road 3 Communication:

> The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul; The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple;

***Psalm 19:7***

God could have chosen many ways to reveal himself to people. Through scripture (holy writing), He has primarily communicated to us through the written word. The root of the word communication- means to "share." God has chosen to share Himself, or reveal Himself mostly, through a book- the Bible.

It is through the words of this book (the Bible) that God gives new life.

> So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

***Romans 10:17***

 
So the Bible tells us that the book itself, is necessary for life transformation- for a new life, it is a road to God and salvation from the penalty of sin. Can you trust the Bible? No other book is like it- it is: reliable, prophetic, unified, durable, sufficient and authoritative.  As importantly, it's real. It explains us and our world in a way that corresponds to reality. It best answers at least four great questions that man-kind has been wrestling with for centuries: How did we get here? Why are we here? Why are we the way we are? And, where are we going from here?
 
Although Christianity is only one of many competing religions and world-views, one writer said, "When faced with a choice among competing propositions of different world-views, we should choose the one that, when applied to the whole of reality, gives us the most coherent picture of the world." The Bible is the true picture of that road.

### Road 4 Christ:

> But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

***Romans 5:8***

Why must Jesus Christ be the final road and ultimate path to God? Because we need forgiveness for our sins that offend a holy God, and it is He who provided that road to forgiveness for us with the death of His own Son.

Why? Because our sin separates us from God eternally and condemns us to judgment in hell.

> And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment

***Hebrews 9:27***
 
> Why Jesus? Because Jesus is God." "I and My Father are one.

***John 10:30***

> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End," says the Lord..., ..."who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.

***Revelation 1:8***
 

How? Because only Jesus as God could make the substitutionary sacrifice necessary for sinners.

> For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.

***2 Corinthians 5:21***

You must now ask yourself, "What do I do with this Jesus?" 
When looking at a similar question, C.S. Lewis, the popular British author and philosopher said:

"I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg - or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse.

You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to."
Lewis is right and you must make a choice. The greatest news in the history of the world (the gospel) is that Jesus Christ- God in the flesh, died for sinners and conquered sin and death by His resurrection, as believers in Him will also.

What should you do? Everyone wants a road to justice, love and forgiveness right? Then confess you're a sinner before God, repent, or turn from your life of sin and rebellion and submit and surrender to Jesus Christ, trusting and believing in Him as the only one that can save you from judgment and you will find eternal peace, justice, love and forgiveness.    
 
> If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.

***Romans 10:9***

> For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation,

***2 Corinthians 7:10***
